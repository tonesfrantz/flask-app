# Challenges:

-   Setting up Amazon S3 to link with the App.
-   CSS
-   Picture size was not reliable as they were not cropped before uploading, this causes size issues.
-   Making the app more interesing and creative was challenging.

# Tasks:

<!-- 1. Build most_popular html. Order the photos by most likes. --> Review after new data has been entered.

<!-- 2. Build Add-photo page and funcitionality. -->

<!-- 3. Click on photo to see it larger. --> CSS to make it more appealing

<!-- 4. User edit function
   make the user list not an edit place.
   once clicked on the user you can edit or delete.

    >

5. User Delete Function. -->

<!-- 6. Adjust delete config so only the user that uploaded can delete. -->

<!-- 7. Group pets by type.
    - make drop down menu in the page which then loads based on that.
    - propogate the page accoringly. -->

<!-- 8. Sign up to S3 database. -->

<!-- 9. Make the page functional on Heroku using the database from Amazon -->

<!-- 10. Add the ability to delete from the Database. - This is proving difficult -->
